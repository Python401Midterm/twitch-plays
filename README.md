## **Twitch Plays and Twitch Bot Python Script**

In this project, we are building a tool that will allow the viewers of a Twitch stream to participate in the game by entering predefined inputs into the chat. This is a fun way for streamers to interact with their viewers!
This project will primarily be written in Python3

### **Project Goals**

The MVP, or base case, is to  create a program  that, when run will allow Twitch stream viewers to play a program with defined key press parameters entered into the stream chat.

### **Stretch goals**

- Create a bot which will filter out  text in the chat that isn't a key press or filter the key presses so that the chat can continue as normal
- Create a full executable file that when run will allow you to define key bindings, mouse movement, input timing, and chat inputs
- Create a user friendly graphic user interface
