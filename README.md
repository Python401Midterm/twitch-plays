# Twitch Plays and Twitch Bot Python Script
### MVP
- Create a program when run will allow a chat to use your computer to play a program with defined key press parameters.
### Stretch Goals:
- Create a bot which will filter out chat that isn't a key press or filter the key presses so that the chat can continue as normal.
- Create a display that shows the key presses
- Create a full exe file that when run will allow you to define each key on your computer and mouse movement, seconds to press as well as chat inputs in order to have a running program witha graphic ui that anyone can use
